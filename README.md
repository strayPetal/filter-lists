# filter lists!

A little collection of a few small filter lists by yours truly, mostly based off of my own browsing experiences. Don't expect too much from them, of course; I'm just keeping these up to date as I please, and won't attempt to actively maintain them (unless of course it breaks something for me), though I will do my best to keep up with any issues if you put them in the [issue tracker](../../issues). No promises though!

Primarily aimed for use with [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com). May work with AdGuard, definitely not with ABP, but I won't be testing anyway. Why? Well, I just don't see the point in using any other blocking extension.

The lists in this repository will be split up into folders, each of which will have a README with more detail about that specific filter list. Regardless, I'll pop the short description of each filter list in the below table...

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [**Fun Laser**](fun-laser) | A rather aggressive blocklist for the sites I frequent. As a laser, its efforts are quite concentrated on select sites, but it does nothing for those that aren't in the line of fire. |
