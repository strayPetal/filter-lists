# filter lists!

A little collection of a few small filter lists by yours truly, mostly based off of my own browsing experiences. Don't expect too much from them, of course; I'm just keeping these up to date as I please, and won't attempt to actively maintain them (unless of course it breaks something for me), though I will do my best to keep up with any issues if you put them in the [issue tracker](../../issues). No promises though!

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Doots** ([subscribe](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strayPetal/filter-lists/main/doots.txt&title=Doots)) | Small, generic privacy-centric blocklist. |
| **Fun Laser** ([subscribe](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strayPetal/filter-lists/main/fun-laser.txt&title=Fun%20Laser)) | A rather aggressive blocklist for the sites I frequent. As a laser, its efforts are quite concentrated on select sites, but it does nothing for those that aren't in the line of fire. |
