! Description: Strip all parameters from a URL by default, and disable on certain sites. Don't use unless you're willing to do some unbreaking!

! The one rule to remove them all!
! Reason why the regex /./ is needed is, if you just did:
!   $doc,removeparam
! Then you'd have to do this to disable it:
!   @@||some.site.com^$doc,removeparam
! But this would then also disable any other removeparam things from other filter lists, which is unwanted because, if you're manually unbreaking, putting in a broad exception rule would leave you vulnerable to all the params that can now flood in unimpeded. 
$doc,removeparam=/./
