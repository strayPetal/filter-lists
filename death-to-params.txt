! Description: Strip all parameters from a URL by default, and disable on certain sites. Don't use unless you're willing to do some unbreaking!

! The one rule to remove them all!
! Why the "removeparam=~", you may ask? If you just did:    $doc,removeparam
! then to disable it you'd need to add a rule like this:    @@||site.to.reallow^$doc,removeparam
! But that would also disable the removeparam rules in other filter lists too, leaving you now vulnerable to all the URL params that can now flow in unimpeded.
! So in doing this, you give yourself a way to disable specifically only this rule, and allow other removeparam rules to function properly.
! By the way, "removeparam=~" I assume just means "remove all params that aren't nothing", and of course a param has to be something, so everything gets removed.
$doc,removeparam=~

! To reiterate, you can safely disable this filter list on specific sites by putting in the following rule:
! @@||site.to.reallow^$doc,removeparam=~

!--- CLEAN UNBREAKS ---!
@@||google.*/search$doc,removeparam=~
||google.*/search$doc,removeparam=~q


!--- DIRTY UNBREAKS ---!
