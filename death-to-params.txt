! Description: Strip all parameters from a URL by default, and disable on certain sites. Don't use unless you're willing to do some unbreaking!

!*  The one rule to remove them all!
!*  Why the "removeparam=~", you may ask? If you just did:    $doc,removeparam
!*  then to disable it you'd need to add a filter like this:  @@||site.to.reallow^$doc,removeparam
!*  ...but that would also disable the removeparam filters in other filter lists too, leaving you now vulnerable to all the URL params that can now flow in unimpeded.
!*  So in doing this, you give yourself a way to disable specifically only this filter, and allow other removeparam filters to function properly.
!*  
!*  By the way, "removeparam=~" I assume just means "remove all params that aren't nothing", and of course a param has to be something, so everything gets removed.
!*  I assume this is more performant than using regex to achieve the same purpose, but I'm not entirely certain.
!*  Using a regex filter also seems to dodge the problem described in the next paragraph...
!*  (I before was using "removeparam=/^/" as my regex filter)
!*  
!*  To reiterate, you can safely disable this filter list on specific sites by adding this filter in your "My filters":
!*  @@||site.to.reallow^$doc,removeparam=~
!*  NOTE: for some reason, if you create an exception filter like that, you no longer get any removeparam entries in Logger, so just bear that in mind when unbreaking sites.
$doc,removeparam=~
