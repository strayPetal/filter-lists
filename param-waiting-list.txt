! Description: Remove URL params not present on DandelionSprout's "Legitimate URL Shortener" (the only list I use that targets params). Holding zone until I (eventually) suggest for their addition to that list.

! docs.google.com
$removeparam=usp

! www.google.com
! $removeparam=sca_upv
! $removeparam=hl
